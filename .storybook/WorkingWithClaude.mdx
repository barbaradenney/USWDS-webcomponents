## Overview

This entire USWDS Web Components library was built using **Claude Code**, Anthropic's AI-powered development assistant. This document explains how Claude was used to build the library and provides practical prompts you can use to work with this codebase effectively.

## ü§ñ About Claude Code

**Claude Code** is an advanced AI assistant that can:
- Read and understand entire codebases
- Write production-quality code following architectural patterns
- Execute commands, run tests, and validate changes
- Follow complex development workflows and standards
- Maintain consistency across large projects
- Generate comprehensive documentation
- Debug complex issues systematically

## üèóÔ∏è How This Library Was Built

### Development Philosophy

Every aspect of this library was created through collaboration with Claude:

1. **Architecture Design** - Claude helped establish the Script Tag Pattern, Light DOM approach, and USWDS-first methodology
2. **Component Implementation** - All 46 components written with Claude following USWDS compliance standards
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - 2301+ tests created with comprehensive coverage
4. **Documentation** - All component READMEs, guides, and Storybook documentation
5. **Automation** - Pre-commit hooks, validation scripts, and CI/CD pipelines
6. **Quality Assurance** - Code reviews, refactoring, and continuous improvement

### Key Achievements

- ‚úÖ **100% USWDS Compliance** - Achieved through systematic validation
- ‚úÖ **Zero Breaking Changes** - Careful architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - Every component fully tested
- ‚úÖ **Complete Documentation** - No component left undocumented
- ‚úÖ **Automated Quality** - 13 pre-commit validation stages

## üí¨ Essential Claude Prompts

### Getting Started with the Codebase

#### Understanding the Project
```
Please read CLAUDE.md and give me an overview of this project's
architecture, key principles, and development workflow.
```

#### Finding Your Way Around
```
Where can I find the documentation for [component-name]?
Show me the component implementation, tests, and README.
```

#### Understanding a Component
```
Explain how the [component-name] component works. Include:
- Its USWDS integration approach
- Key properties and events
- Testing strategy
- Any special architectural considerations
```

### Creating New Components

#### Generate a Component (Recommended)
```
I need to create a new component called [component-name].
Use the component generator to scaffold it with all required files.

Command: npm run generate:component -- --interactive
```

#### Manual Component Creation
```
Create a new USWDS component for [component-name] following these requirements:
1. Follow the Script Tag Pattern (mandatory)
2. Use Light DOM (no Shadow DOM)
3. Match official USWDS structure from node_modules/@uswds/uswds/packages/usa-[component]
4. Include comprehensive tests with accessibility validation
5. Create Storybook stories with all variants
6. Write component README.mdx with USWDS links
7. Ensure 100% USWDS compliance

Reference: docs/COMPONENT_TEMPLATES.md
```

#### Component with Complex Behavior
```
Create a [component-name] component that needs custom behavior mirroring.
This component has complex interactions that require a separate behavior file.

Requirements:
1. Create usa-[component]-behavior.ts that replicates USWDS JavaScript
2. Source: node_modules/@uswds/uswds/packages/usa-[component]/src/index.js
3. Document all USWDS source references
4. Follow Pattern 2 from USWDS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

The component needs: [describe specific behaviors]
```

### Testing and Validation

#### Run All Tests Before Committing
```
Run the complete test suite to ensure nothing is broken:

Commands:
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:run -- --all   # All tests (comprehensive)
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript validation
npm run lint               # Code quality
npm run validate           # All pre-commit checks
```

#### Fix Test Failures
```
The tests are failing with these errors: [paste error output]

Please investigate and fix the issues. Follow the debugging protocol:
1. Check docs/USWDS_JAVASCRIPT_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md
2. Compare with USWDS source in node_modules/@uswds/uswds
3. Verify USWDS integration patterns
4. Run tests after each fix
```

#### Add Tests for Existing Component
```
The [component-name] component needs better test coverage. Add:
1. Unit tests for all properties and methods
2. Accessibility tests (axe-core validation)
3. Interactive behavior tests (if applicable)
4. USWDS compliance tests

Current coverage: [describe what exists]
Missing coverage: [describe gaps]
```

### Debugging and Fixing Issues

#### Component Not Working in Storybook
```
The [component-name] component isn't working correctly in Storybook.

Symptoms: [describe what you're seeing]
Expected: [describe expected behavior]

Please debug using:
1. docs/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md

‚ùå "Fix the button component"
‚úÖ "The button component's hover state isn't working in Safari. The expected behavior is [X] but actual is [Y]. Please debug following USWDS_JAVASCRIPT_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md"

### 2. Reference Documentation
‚ùå "Make it follow our patterns"
‚úÖ "Implement following the Script Tag Pattern described in CLAUDE.md and USWDS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md section 2.1"

### 3. Provide Context
‚ùå "Tests are failing"
‚úÖ "Tests are failing with error: [paste error]. This started after [change]. The component uses [USWDS pattern]. Reference: [file:line]"

### 4. Request Validation
‚ùå "Is this done?"
‚úÖ "Please verify this implementation: 1) All tests pass, 2) USWDS compliant, 3) Documentation updated, 4) Storybook working, 5) Pre-commit hooks pass"

### 5. Ask for Explanations
‚ùå "Why doesn't this work?"
‚úÖ "Explain why the Script Tag Pattern is required for this component and what would happen if we used ES module imports instead"

### 6. Request Step-by-Step Approaches
‚ùå "Build feature X"
‚úÖ "Build feature X following this workflow: 1) Design, 2) Implement, 3) Test, 4) Document, 5) Validate. Let's start with step 1 design"
