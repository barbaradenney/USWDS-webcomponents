            This PR contains code that violates the minimal wrapper principle. Please review the violations and fix them before merging.

            ### 📖 Resources
            - **CLAUDE.md Over-Engineering Prevention Guidelines**: Comprehensive prevention framework
            - **Decision Tree**: Research USWDS source before implementing custom logic
            - **Examples**: See code examples of violations vs valid patterns

            ### 🛠️ How to Fix
            1. Research the USWDS source code for your component
            2. Remove custom event handlers and let USWDS handle behavior
            3. Ensure components always initialize USWDS (no mode switching)
            4. Run \`npm run detect:over-engineering\` locally to verify fixes

            ### 💡 Remember
            We are **HTML structure providers**, not **behavior implementers**. Let USWDS do what it does best!`
