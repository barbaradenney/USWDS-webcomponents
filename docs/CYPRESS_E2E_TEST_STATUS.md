# Cypress E2E Test Status

## Overview

During the test skip migration effort, 6 new Cypress E2E tests were created to provide browser-environment coverage for functionality that cannot be tested in jsdom/Vitest:

1. `cypress/e2e/combo-box-dom-structure.cy.ts` (372 lines)
2. `cypress/e2e/site-alert-dom-manipulation.cy.ts` (452 lines)
3. `cypress/e2e/file-input-drag-drop.cy.ts` (467 lines - expanded)
4. `cypress/e2e/date-picker-month-navigation.cy.ts` (468 lines)
5. `cypress/e2e/modal-programmatic-api.cy.ts` (542 lines)
6. `cypress/e2e/language-selector-behavior.cy.ts` (566 lines)

**Total: 2,867 lines of new/expanded E2E test coverage**

## Current Status: ⚠️ Tests Need Validation

### Test Execution Results

When running the new Cypress tests, several issues were discovered:

- **combo-box-dom-structure.cy.ts**: 18 passing, 7 failing
- **site-alert-dom-manipulation.cy.ts**: Test execution timed out
- **file-input-drag-drop.cy.ts**: Test execution timed out
- **date-picker-month-navigation.cy.ts**: Multiple element not found errors
- **modal-programmatic-api.cy.ts**: Partial execution, timing out
- **language-selector-behavior.cy.ts**: Test execution timed out

### Common Failure Patterns

1. **Element Not Found**: `Expected to find element: 'usa-combo-box', but never found it`
2. **Story Loading Issues**: Stories may not be loading at expected URLs
3. **Timeout Issues**: Tests are taking too long and hitting Cypress timeouts
4. **Selector Problems**: Some CSS selectors may not match actual rendered DOM

## Root Cause Analysis

The tests were created based on:
- Knowledge of USWDS component structure
- Assumptions about Storybook story URLs
- Expected component behavior

However, they were **not validated** against actual running Storybook before being committed.

## Required Fixes

### 1. Verify Story URLs

Each test uses a URL like:
```typescript
cy.visit('/iframe.html?id=components-combo-box--default&viewMode=story');
```

**Action needed**: Verify each story ID matches actual Storybook story format

### 2. Fix Element Selectors

Tests assume certain DOM structures. Need to:
- Start Storybook: `npm run storybook`
- Open each story in browser
- Inspect actual rendered HTML
- Update selectors to match reality

### 3. Adjust Wait Times

Current waits (100ms-1000ms) may be insufficient for:
- USWDS JavaScript initialization
- Storybook iframe loading
- Component rendering

**Action needed**: Add longer waits or use proper `cy.should()` retry assertions

### 4. Handle Storybook Loading

Tests should:
- Wait for Storybook iframe to be ready
- Wait for USWDS JavaScript to initialize
- Verify component is actually rendered before interacting

### 5. Test Against Actual Browser

Run tests against live Storybook:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Storybook
npm run storybook

# Terminal 2: Run Cypress with UI
npx cypress open

# Or run headless after fixes
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/combo-box-dom-structure.cy.ts"
```

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Start Simple
1. Start with one test file (combo-box - has some passing tests)
2. Fix the 7 failing tests
3. Verify all 25 tests pass reliably
4. Document the fix patterns

### Phase 2: Apply Learnings
1. Apply same fixes to other test files
2. Run each test file individually
3. Debug and fix issues one at a time

### Phase 3: Full Validation
1. Run all 6 test files together
2. Verify no conflicts or race conditions
3. Add retry logic where needed
4. Update documentation with actual coverage

## Current Documentation Status

The validation script (`scripts/validate/validate-no-skipped-tests.cjs`) has been updated to reference these Cypress tests as providing coverage for skipped Vitest tests:

```javascript
'src/components/combo-box/combo-box-dom-validation.test.ts': {
  count: 1,
  reason: 'BROWSER_ONLY',
  documented: 'Requires USWDS DOM transformation - Cypress coverage: cypress/e2e/combo-box-dom-structure.cy.ts',
},
```

**However**: This documentation claims coverage that doesn't yet exist in a working state.

## Impact on Test Skip Migration

- **Vitest tests**: All passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- **Skipped tests**: Properly documented with Cypress coverage references
- **Cypress tests**: Created but not yet validated ⚠️

The skip migration is **architecturally complete** but **functionally incomplete** until the Cypress tests are fixed and validated.

## Next Steps

1. **Start Storybook**: `npm run storybook`
2. **Open Cypress UI**: `npx cypress open`
3. **Run tests one by one** in Cypress UI to see actual failures
4. **Fix selectors and waits** based on real behavior
5. **Verify all tests pass** before considering the work complete
6. **Update this document** with final status

## Estimated Effort

- **Time to fix**: 2-4 hours per test file
- **Total effort**: 12-24 hours to complete all 6 files
- **Complexity**: Medium - mostly selector and timing fixes

## Success Criteria

✅ All 6 Cypress E2E test files pass reliably
✅ Tests can run in CI/CD environment
✅ Tests provide actual coverage for skipped Vitest tests
✅ Documentation accurately reflects working coverage
