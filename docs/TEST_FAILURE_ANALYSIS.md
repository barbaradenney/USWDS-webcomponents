# Test Failure Analysis - Pre-Publication

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Context:** Publication readiness check for uswds-webcomponents v1.0.0
**Test Run:** Complete unit test suite via `npm run test:run -- --unit`

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Package has **113 failing tests** across 21 components, contradicting documentation that claimed "2301/2301 passing tests (100%)".

**Publication Status:** ðŸš¨ **BLOCKED** - Cannot publish with failing tests

**Primary Issues:**
1. **16 DataTransfer API failures** (browser-only API, JSDOM limitation)
2. **97 other failures** across components (USWDS integration, assertions, DOM queries)
3. **Documentation accuracy** - test status was incorrectly reported

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Browser API Limitations (16 failures)

**Issue:** DataTransfer API not available in JSDOM (Node.js test environment)

**Error:**
```
DataTransfer is not defined
```

**Affected Component:** File Input (usa-file-input-behavior.test.ts)

**Examples:**
- "should display preview heading after file selection"
- "should hide instructions when file is selected"
- "should show correct file count for multiple files"
- All Contract 4 tests (File Selection and Previews)

**Root Cause:** Browser-only API (`DataTransfer`, used for file drag-and-drop) is not available in JSDOM.

**Recommendation:** These tests should be:
1. Moved to Cypress component tests (real browser environment)
2. OR skipped in Vitest with proper documentation
3. OR mocked with a DataTransfer polyfill

---

### Pattern 2: Assertion Mismatches (30+ failures)

**Issue:** Tests expecting specific values that don't match actual component behavior

**Error Examples:**
```
â†’ expected false to be true // Object.is equality
â†’ expected '0' to be '100' // Object.is equality
â†’ expected 'On this page' to be 'Custom Title' // Object.is equality
â†’ expected 'H4' to be 'H3' // Object.is equality
```

**Affected Components:** In-Page Navigation, Banner, Time Picker, Header

**Root Cause:** Either:
- Component implementation doesn't match test expectations
- Tests are checking wrong properties/values
- USWDS behavior differs from test assumptions

**Recommendation:** Case-by-case review needed to determine:
1. Is component behavior correct per USWDS spec?
2. Are test expectations wrong?
3. Is this a real bug?

---

### Pattern 3: DOM Query Failures (25+ failures)

**Issue:** Tests expecting DOM elements that don't exist or are null

**Error Examples:**
```
â†’ expected null to be truthy
â†’ Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getAttribute')
â†’ Cannot read properties of null (reading 'click')
â†’ Should have USWDS wrapper: expected null to be truthy
â†’ Should find input trigger: expected null to be truthy
```

**Affected Components:** Modal, Tooltip, Date Picker, Character Count, Card

**Root Cause:** Either:
- USWDS hasn't transformed DOM yet (timing issue)
- Component doesn't render expected structure
- Test queries are incorrect

**Recommendation:**
1. Check if tests need to wait for USWDS transformation
2. Verify component renders correct DOM structure
3. Check if selectors are accurate

---

### Pattern 4: USWDS Integration Failures (20+ failures)

**Issue:** USWDS JavaScript not properly initializing or enhancing components

**Error Examples:**
```
ðŸ”§ Date Range Picker: USWDS integration failed: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')
â†’ expected undefined to be 'Updated tooltip text' // Object.is equality
â†’ expected undefined to be true // Object.is equality
```

**Affected Components:** Date Range Picker (28 errors in logs), Time Picker, Tooltip, Modal

**Root Cause:**
- USWDS trying to access DOM elements that don't exist yet
- Component structure doesn't match USWDS expectations
- Timing issues with USWDS initialization

**Recommendation:**
1. Ensure components render USWDS-expected DOM before initialization
2. Add proper initialization guards
3. Verify USWDS compatibility of component structure

---

### Pattern 5: Accessibility Test Failures (8 failures)

**Issue:** Accessibility attributes/properties not set correctly

**Error Examples:**
```
â†’ Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'labelledby')
â†’ Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'describedby')
â†’ expected { â€¦(4) } to have property "outlineStyle"
```

**Affected Components:** Character Count, Tag, Button Group, Card

**Root Cause:**
- ARIA attributes missing or incorrect
- Focus indicators not rendering
- Accessibility metadata undefined

**Recommendation:**
1. Verify all required ARIA attributes are set
2. Check focus indicator CSS
3. Ensure accessibility metadata is properly initialized

---

### Pattern 6: Regression Test Failures (10+ failures)

**Issue:** Tests designed to prevent regressions are failing

**Components:**
- Button Layout Tests - CSS class regression (5 failures)
- Alert Layout Tests - Visual regression (4 failures)
- Footer Layout Tests - Structure regression (2 failures)
- Card Layout Tests - Content regression (1 failure)

**Error Examples:**
```
Ã— should have clean CSS classes for primary button variant
Ã— should handle no-icon variant correctly
Ã— should position identifier section correctly when present
```

**Root Cause:**
- Recent component changes broke regression contracts
- Regression tests have incorrect baselines
- Component refactoring introduced breaking changes

**Recommendation:** Critical - regression failures indicate breaking changes that need immediate attention.

---

## Publication Impact Assessment

### Severity Classification

#### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Publication Blockers)
**Count:** 97 failures

**Categories:**
1. **Assertion Mismatches** - Core functionality not working as expected
2. **DOM Query Failures** - Components not rendering expected structure
3. **USWDS Integration Failures** - Components failing to work with USWDS
4. **Regression Test Failures** - Breaking changes to established functionality
5. **Accessibility Failures** - WCAG compliance issues

**Why Blocking:** These indicate actual bugs, broken functionality, or non-compliance with USWDS/WCAG standards. Cannot publish library with broken components.

#### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM (Should Fix but Not Blocking)
**Count:** 16 failures

**Categories:**
1. **DataTransfer API failures** (File Input)

**Why Not Blocking:** Browser API limitation in test environment, not actual component bug. File input works in real browsers, just can't test in JSDOM.

**Resolution:** Move to Cypress tests or skip with documentation.

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Why Documentation Was Incorrect

The "2301/2301 passing tests (100%)" claim appears to have been based on:

1. **Test Skip Count Reduction Work** - Previous focus was on reducing skipped tests from 44 to 9
2. **Skipped vs Failed Confusion** - Documentation tracked skipped tests (`.skip()`) but didn't account for actually failing tests (`Ã—`)
3. **Partial Test Runs** - May have run specific test files that passed, not full suite
4. **CI/CD Differences** - GitHub Actions may have different behavior than local runs

### Evidence
- Found 9 documented skipped tests (`.skip()`) - this was accurate
- Found 113 failing tests (`Ã—`) - this was not documented
- Test output clearly shows `Ã—` failures, not just skips
- Multiple components have assertion failures, not just skip markers

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Triage (1-2 hours)

1. **Categorize all 113 failures** into:
   - Browser API limitations (can skip)
   - Test bugs (fix tests, not code)
   - Component bugs (fix component code)
   - USWDS integration issues (timing/structure)

2. **Identify Quick Wins** (tests that are easy to fix):
   - Incorrect test expectations
   - Missing `await` statements
   - Wrong selectors

3. **Identify Must-Fix** (actual component bugs):
   - Accessibility violations
   - Breaking regressions
   - USWDS non-compliance

### Phase 2: Fix Critical Issues (3-5 hours)

1. **Fix Regression Failures** (10 tests)
   - Button CSS classes
   - Alert layout
   - Footer structure
   - Card content

2. **Fix Accessibility Failures** (8 tests)
   - Character count ARIA
   - Tag contrast
   - Button group forms
   - Card accessibility

3. **Fix USWDS Integration** (20 tests)
   - Modal transformation
   - Tooltip positioning
   - Time picker combo box
   - Date range picker

### Phase 3: Resolve Remaining Issues (2-3 hours)

1. **DOM Query Failures** - Add proper waits/checks
2. **Assertion Mismatches** - Fix tests or components
3. **DataTransfer Failures** - Move to Cypress or skip

### Phase 4: Verification (1 hour)

1. Run full test suite again
2. Verify all critical tests pass
3. Document any remaining justified skips
4. Update test status documentation

**Estimated Total Time:** 7-11 hours

## Alternative: Minimum Viable Publication

If full fix is not feasible before publication deadline:

### Option 1: Skip Non-Critical Tests
- Skip all 16 DataTransfer tests (browser API limitation)
- Document known issues in CHANGELOG
- Add "Known Issues" section to README
- Commit to fixing post-launch

### Option 2: Beta/RC Release
- Publish as `1.0.0-rc.1` (release candidate)
- Mark package with "beta" tag on NPM
- Document test failures in release notes
- Fix issues before promoting to stable `1.0.0`

### Option 3: Delay Publication
- Fix all critical failures first
- Ensure 100% test pass rate
- Publish stable `1.0.0` when ready

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (Delay Publication) is strongly recommended. Publishing with 113 failing tests would:
- Damage library credibility
- Violate USWDS compliance claims
- Risk accessibility issues for users
- Create technical debt

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** with stakeholder/team
2. **Choose action plan** (full fix vs. minimum viable vs. delay)
3. **Begin triage** of all 113 failures
4. **Create detailed task list** for fixes
5. **Execute fixes** systematically
6. **Re-run tests** to verify
7. **Update documentation** with accurate test status
8. **Proceed to publication** only when tests pass

---

## Test Execution Details

**Command:** `npm run test:run -- --unit`
**Environment:** Node.js + JSDOM (Vitest)
**Duration:** ~5 minutes (152 test files)
**Output:** `/tmp/test-full-output.txt` (8871 lines)

**Test Files Run:** 152
**Total Tests:** ~2300+ tests
**Failures:** 113 tests (Ã—)
**Skipped:** 9 tests (.skip() - documented)
**Passing:** ~2188 tests (estimated)

**Pass Rate:** ~95% (not 100% as documented)

---

## Conclusion

**Publication Readiness:** ðŸš¨ **NOT READY**

The package has significant test failures that must be addressed before publication. While 95% of tests pass, the 113 failing tests indicate:
- Broken functionality in multiple components
- USWDS integration issues
- Accessibility compliance problems
- Regression in established features

**Recommendation:** Fix critical failures before publishing v1.0.0. The library's credibility depends on delivering stable, tested, USWDS-compliant components.

---

**Next Action:** Begin Phase 1 (Immediate Triage) to categorize all failures and create fix roadmap.
