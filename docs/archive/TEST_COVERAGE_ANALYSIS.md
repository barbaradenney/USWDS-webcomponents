## What's Needed for Complete Coverage

### Priority 1: Fix Vitest Test Timeout Issue

**Problem**: `npm test` times out after 2 minutes
**Impact**: Can't verify unit test pass rate
**Action Required**:
1. Investigate which test suite is hanging
2. Add appropriate timeouts or fix infinite loops
3. Run tests with `--reporter=verbose` to identify problematic tests
4. Consider splitting long-running tests

**Commands to Try**:
```bash
# Run with verbose output to see which test hangs
npm test -- --reporter=verbose

# Run specific component tests individually
npm test src/components/date-picker

# Check for infinite loops or missing async/await
```

---

### Priority 2: Address 59 Unapproved Skipped Tests

**Three Options for Each Skip**:

#### Option A: Fix the Test (Preferred)
- Most skips are likely fixable
- Review why test was skipped originally
- Update test expectations to match USWDS behavior
- Remove `.skip()` once fixed

#### Option B: Add Cypress Coverage + Document
- If test requires browser APIs
- Create corresponding Cypress test
- Add coverage comment to Vitest test
- Update validation script APPROVED_SKIPS

#### Option C: Archive as Not Applicable
- If testing behavior that doesn't exist in USWDS
- If testing removed/deprecated functionality
- Document why test is archived
- Consider deleting rather than skipping

---

### Priority 3: Improve Cypress Pass Rates (60% ‚Üí 75%+)

**File Input (58% ‚Üí 75-85%)**
- 8 failing tests
- Action: Review USWDS file-input JavaScript behavior
- Expected: Adjust error message and processing expectations
- Effort: 1-2 hours

**Character Count (41% ‚Üí 55-65%)**
- 10 failing tests
- Action: Add appropriate timing delays for USWDS behavior
- Expected: Adjust assertions for status message updates
- Effort: 2-3 hours

**Summary Box (50% ‚Üí 64%)**
- 7 failing tests, 2 skipped
- Action: Refactor for-loop tests to recursive pattern
- Expected: Fix Cypress syntax limitations
- Effort: 1 hour

**Alert (73% ‚Üí 85%)**
- 3 failing tests
- Action: Review edge cases in accessibility compliance
- Expected: Minor assertion adjustments
- Effort: 30 minutes

**Button Group (77% ‚Üí 85%)**
- 5 failing tests
- Action: Determine if pixel-perfect layout variations are acceptable
- Expected: Either fix or document as browser variations
- Effort: 1 hour

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize Unit Tests (High Priority)
**Goal**: Get Vitest tests running to completion
**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours

1. **Investigate Test Timeout**
   - Run tests with verbose output
   - Identify hanging test suite
   - Fix infinite loops or add timeouts
   - Verify all tests complete

2. **Get Baseline Pass Rate**
   - Once tests complete, document pass rate
   - Identify failing tests
   - Categorize failures (real issues vs test issues)

---

### Phase 2: Clean Up Skipped Tests (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Reduce unapproved skips from 59 to 0
**Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours

**Group 1: Behavior Contract Tests (9 skips)**
- Files: `*-behavior.test.ts` with `describe.skip('USWDS Behavior Contract')`
- Action: Either implement behavior tests or document as browser-only
- Time: 3-4 hours

**Group 2: Date Picker Tests (25 skips)**
- Largest concentration of skips
- Action: Review if these need Cypress coverage or can be fixed
- Time: 4-6 hours

**Group 3: Modal/Tooltip Tests (12 skips)**
- Mix of accessibility and behavior tests
- Action: Likely need Cypress coverage for browser APIs
- Time: 2-3 hours

**Group 4: Layout Tests (5 skips)**
- Positioning and CSS tests
- Action: May need Cypress for actual layout testing
- Time: 1-2 hours

**Group 5: Miscellaneous (8 skips)**
- Various components
- Action: Review individually
- Time: 2-3 hours

---

### Phase 3: Improve Cypress Coverage (Lower Priority)
**Goal**: Achieve 75%+ pass rate
**Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours

1. **File Input Refinement** (2 hours)
   - Review USWDS source
   - Adjust test expectations
   - Expected: +7-8 tests passing

2. **Character Count Timing** (3 hours)
   - Add timing delays
   - Adjust USWDS behavior expectations
   - Expected: +6-7 tests passing

3. **Summary Box For Loops** (1 hour)
   - Refactor 2 tests
   - Expected: +2 tests passing

4. **Alert Edge Cases** (30 min)
   - Minor adjustments
   - Expected: +1-2 tests passing

5. **Button Group Review** (30 min)
   - Determine acceptability of failures
   - Document or fix
   - Expected: +0-3 tests passing

---

## Long-Term Coverage Goals

### Expand Cypress Coverage to All Components

**Currently Tested** (5 components):
- Alert
- Button Group
- File Input
- Summary Box
- Character Count

**Need Cypress Tests** (41 components):
All remaining USWDS components should have browser-based tests for:
- User interactions
- Keyboard navigation
- Accessibility (with axe-core)
- USWDS JavaScript behavior
- Browser API usage

**Effort**: ~2-4 hours per component = 80-160 hours total

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. Why are Vitest tests timing out?
**Action**: Run with verbose output to identify problematic test
**Priority**: CRITICAL - blocking visibility into unit test status

### 2. Are the 59 unapproved skips legitimate?
**Action**: Review each skip to determine if it's:
- A test issue (fix the test)
- A browser requirement (add Cypress coverage)
- No longer applicable (delete the test)
**Priority**: HIGH - technical debt

### 3. What's the actual Vitest pass rate?
**Action**: Fix timeout issue to get baseline
**Priority**: HIGH - need baseline for improvement tracking

### 4. Are Cypress test failures real component issues?
**Action**: Review each failure to determine if it's:
- A component bug (fix component)
- A test expectation issue (fix test)
- Acceptable browser variation (document)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - most are likely test expectation issues

   - Look for infinite loops or missing async/await
   - Add appropriate timeouts

2. **Review Date Picker Skips** (1 hour)
   - 25 skipped tests is the largest concentration
   - Determine if they need Cypress coverage or can be fixed
   - Create action plan for this component

3. **Continue Cypress Refinement** (2 hours)
   - Start with file-input (quick wins expected)
   - Review USWDS file-input JavaScript
   - Adjust test expectations

### For Future Sessions

1. **Systematic Skip Review** (8-12 hours)
   - Work through unapproved skips methodically
   - Fix, document, or delete each one
