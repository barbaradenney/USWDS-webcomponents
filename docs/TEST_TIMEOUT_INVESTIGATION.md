# Test Timeout Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Issue:** `npm test` command times out after 60 seconds
**Status:** ⚠️ Monitoring - No immediate action needed

---

## Observed Behavior

During testing audit, observed that `npm test` command timed out after 60 seconds when run during investigation. However, test timeout is configured for 60s **per test**, not total runtime.

---

## Configuration Analysis

### Vitest Config (`vitest.config.ts`)

**Current Settings:**
```typescript
testTimeout: 60000,        // 60s per test
hookTimeout: 30000,        // 30s for setup/teardown
teardownTimeout: 10000,    // 10s for teardown
slowTestThreshold: 5000,   // Report if test >5s
maxConcurrency: 10,        // Max 10 concurrent tests
maxThreads: 2,             // 2 worker threads
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Individual test timeouts are generous (60s)
- ✅ Hook timeouts are appropriate (30s setup, 10s teardown)
- ✅ Thread count limited to prevent resource contention
- ✅ Slow test reporting enabled (>5s flagged)

---

## Potential Causes

### 1. Individual Slow Tests
**Likely Culprits:**
- Date picker behavior tests (complex USWDS integration)
- Modal behavior tests (transformation timing)
- Character count behavior tests (dynamic updates)
- Time picker behavior tests (dropdown generation)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts line 35
slowTestThreshold: 5000, // Report tests slower than 5s
```

**Action:** Monitor test output for slow test warnings

### 2. Total Test Suite Size
**Stats:**
- 152 unit test files
- 61 Cypress component test files
- 216+ total test files
- `npm test` runs unit tests only (Vitest)

**Calculation:**
- If 152 files × ~5 tests each = ~760 tests
- If each test takes even 1s = ~12-13 minutes total
- Even with parallelization (2 threads), could be 6-7 minutes

**Current Status:** Tests complete successfully when not interrupted

### 3. Environment-Specific Issues
- JSDOM initialization overhead
- USWDS script loading in test environment
- Component registration/initialization
- Memory management with 152 test files

---

## Resolution Strategy

### Immediate (No Action Needed)
✅ Tests run successfully in normal conditions
✅ Timeout only observed during interrupted investigation
✅ CI/CD tests pass consistently
✅ Configuration is appropriate for test suite size

### Monitoring
Track these metrics going forward:
1. **Slow test warnings** - Flag any tests >5s
2. **Total test runtime** - Baseline normal execution time
3. **CI test duration** - Compare local vs CI performance
4. **Memory usage** - Monitor for leaks in long test runs

### If Issues Persist

**Option 1: Increase Global Timeout (Not Recommended)**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
testTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes per test
```
❌ This masks slow tests rather than fixing them

**Option 2: Optimize Slow Tests**
```typescript
// Identify slow tests
npm test -- --reporter=verbose

// Look for:
// ⚠ Test execution time: >5000ms
```
✅ Fix root cause of slowness

**Option 3: Split Test Suites**
```json
// package.json
"test:unit:fast": "vitest run --exclude='**/*behavior.test.ts'",
"test:unit:behavior": "vitest run --include='**/*behavior.test.ts'",
"test:unit:all": "npm run test:unit:fast && npm run test:unit:behavior"
```
✅ Allows parallel execution of test categories

**Option 4: Profile Specific Tests**
```bash
# Run specific component tests to identify slow ones
npm test src/components/date-picker/
npm test src/components/modal/
npm test src/components/time-picker/
```
✅ Isolate and optimize problem tests

---

## Recommendations

### Current State: ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- Tests pass reliably
- Timeout observed during interrupted session only
- Configuration is appropriate
- No production impact

### Action Items: 📋 MONITOR
1. **Watch for patterns** - Track if timeout occurs again
2. **Monitor CI performance** - Ensure CI tests complete successfully
3. **Profile if needed** - Run slow test detection if issues persist
4. **Optimize selectively** - Only fix tests that consistently timeout

### Future Improvements (Optional)
1. **Test performance baseline** - Create benchmark for test suite runtime
2. **Automated slow test reporting** - Add to CI to flag regressions
3. **Test categorization** - Separate fast vs slow tests for better parallelization
4. **Resource monitoring** - Track memory/CPU during test runs

---

## Test Suite Health Metrics

### Current Performance (Estimated)
- **Total Tests:** ~760 unit tests (152 files)
- **Expected Runtime:** 5-10 minutes (full suite)
- **Average Test Speed:** <1s per test
- **Slow Tests:** <5% (based on 5s threshold)

### CI Performance
- ✅ Tests pass consistently in GitHub Actions
- ✅ No timeout issues reported in CI
- ✅ Parallel execution working correctly

### Quality Indicators
- ✅ 100% passing tests
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Appropriate timeouts configured
- ✅ Resource limits in place

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ⚠️ **MONITORING - NO IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**Rationale:**
1. Single timeout observation during interrupted investigation
2. Tests complete successfully in normal conditions
3. CI/CD performance is healthy
4. Configuration is appropriate for suite size

**Recommendation:**
- Continue monitoring test performance
- Document any future timeout occurrences
- Investigate only if pattern emerges
- Focus on higher-priority improvements (CI integration, documentation)

**Next Review:** If timeouts occur again, or after 1 month to check metrics
