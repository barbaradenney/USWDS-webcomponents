# Test Skip - Immediate Actions Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1 Complete - Moving to Phase 2
**Quick Wins:** 1 test fixed

## Current State

### Skip Count
- **Total Skipped Tests:** 92
- **Approved Baseline:** 9
- **Unapproved Skips:** 83 (92 - 9 = 83)
- **Target:** 0 unapproved skips

**Note:** Count increased from initial 88 due to more thorough scanning. Successfully fixed 1 modal test.

### Immediate Success âœ…
**Just Fixed:**
- `src/components/modal/usa-modal.test.ts` - "should remain in DOM after property updates (not auto-dismiss)"
  - **Reason**: This test doesn't actually require browser APIs
  - **Action**: Removed `.skip()`
  - **Result**: âœ… PASSES

## Quick Win Candidates (Can Be Fixed Immediately)

Based on analysis, these tests can likely be unskipped and will pass in Vitest:

### 1. Modal Tests (2-3 more candidates)
- `should handle rapid property updates without breaking` - Similar to the one we just fixed
- DOM presence tests that don't require focus/rendering

### 2. Summary Box Tests
- `should handle mixed slot and property content transitions` - Might work with better waits
- `should not create memory leaks with content changes` - Just counts DOM elements

## Work Completed Today

### âœ… Phase 1 Deliverables
1. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Counted all 88 skipped tests
   - Categorized by component and reason
   - Identified browser-dependent vs fixable

2. **Documentation**
   - Created `TEST_SKIP_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md` (4-week plan)
   - Created this immediate actions document
   - Identified migration patterns

3. **First Success**
   - Fixed 1 modal test
   - Verified it passes
   - Reduced skip count: 88 â†’ 87

## Next Steps (This Week)

### Tomorrow
1. **Fix 5-10 More Quick Wins**
   - Modal: rapid property updates test
   - Summary box: 2 content tests
   - Any other DOM-only tests

2. **Update Approved Skips**
   - Add browser-dependent tests to approved list
   - Document each with clear reasoning
   - Reference Cypress coverage

### This Week
1. **Cypress Migration Assessment**
   - Review existing Cypress tests
   - Identify what's already covered
   - Plan migration for remaining tests

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update TEST_SKIP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
   - Create Cypress migration guide
   - Document all approved skips

## Success Metrics

### Today âœ…

- [x] Created comprehensive plan
- [x] Fixed first test
- [x] Documented strategy

### This Week ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] Fix 5-10 tests (quick wins)
- [ ] Document browser-dependent skips
- [ ] Create Cypress migration plan
- [ ] Get team approval on strategy

### This Month ðŸš€
- [ ] Migrate 25-30 tests to Cypress
- [ ] Document all approved skips
- [ ] Achieve 0 unapproved skips
- [ ] 100% test documentation

## Files Created/Modified Today

### New Documents
1. `docs/TEST_SKIP_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md` - Complete 4-week strategy
2. `docs/TEST_SKIP_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/modal/usa-modal.test.ts` - Fixed 1 test
2. `src/components/date-picker/usa-date-picker.test.ts` - Fixed button wait issue
3. `src/components/in-page-navigation/usa-in-page-navigation.ts` - Fixed TypeScript error

## Key Insights

### What We Learned
1. **Not All Skips Need Browser**
   - Some tests are skipped unnecessarily
   - Many just need better waits or assertions
   - Quick wins available for immediate fixes

2. **Clear Categories**
   - ~30 tests: Calendar/Dropdown UI (need Cypress)
   - ~20 tests: Focus management (need Cypress)
   - ~17 tests: Browser APIs (DataTransfer)
   - ~10 tests: Potentially fixable in Vitest

3. **Cypress Coverage Exists**
   - Several test files already in `cypress/e2e/`
   - May already cover some skipped tests
   - Need to audit and verify

### Recommendations
1. **Start with Quick Wins**
   - Fix 5-10 tests this week
   - Build momentum
   - Show progress

2. **Cypress Migration**
   - Audit existing coverage first
   - Don't duplicate tests
   - Focus on true browser-dependent tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Every skip needs clear reason
   - Reference alternative coverage
   - Get team approval

## Team Communication

### Message for Team
> We've identified 88 skipped tests in the codebase. Today we:
> - Created a comprehensive 4-week plan to address all skips
> - Fixed our first test (modal DOM persistence)
> - Categorized all skips by resolution strategy
>
> **Quick wins available:** 5-10 tests can be fixed immediately
> **Cypress migration needed:** ~60 tests require real browser
> **Documentation needed:** All skips need approval
>
> **Next:** Fix quick wins this week, create Cypress migration plan

**Owner:** Development Team
**Next Review:** End of week
**Success Criteria:** 87 â†’ 80 skips by Friday (7 fixed)
