- [ ] Verify changelog generation works
- [ ] Test version bump workflow
- [ ] Document changeset process in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Add changeset GitHub Action (if not present)

**Current Status**:
- Changesets installed: `@changesets/cli`, `@changesets/changelog-github`
- Publishing workflow exists: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Need to verify full integration

---

### 6. Performance Budgets in CI
**Status**: Pending
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes
**Impact**: Medium - Prevent performance regressions

**Why**: Catch bundle size and performance regressions before merge.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review existing bundle-size workflow
- [ ] Add Lighthouse CI for performance scores
