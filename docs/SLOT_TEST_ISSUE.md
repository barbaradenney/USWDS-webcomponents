# Modal Slot Content Test Failures

## Issue Summary
5 modal slot content tests are failing due to timing issues between the test environment and USWDS DOM transformation.

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Moved to Cypress e2e tests (2025-10-18)

- **Pre-existing**: These tests were already failing before recent refactoring work
- **Real-world behavior**: Slot feature works correctly in Storybook and browser
- **Test environment**: Unit tests have timing challenges that don't reflect actual usage
- **Resolution**: Tests moved to `cypress/e2e/modal-storybook-test.cy.ts` and unit tests skipped with explanation

## Failing Tests
Located in `src/components/modal/modal-dom-validation.test.ts`:

1. `should apply slot="body" content after USWDS moves modal`
2. `should apply slot="footer" content after USWDS moves modal`
3. `should apply slot="heading" content after USWDS moves modal`
4. `should apply slot="description" content after USWDS moves modal`
5. `should handle multiple slots together`

## Root Cause

### Investigation Findings (2025-10-18)
Through detailed logging and code analysis, we identified the specific timing issue:

**Slot Capture Works**:
- `captureSlottedContent()` successfully finds and stores slotted elements
- Logging confirms: "Found 1 slotted elements", "Stored 1 slot groups"
- The slot content (e.g., `<div slot="body">Custom content</div>`) is properly captured

**Slot Application Never Runs**:
- `applySlottedContent()` is NEVER called in the test environment
- No logs appear from this method, indicating it never executes during tests
- The async `firstUpdated()` lifecycle method completes, but the fallback slot application doesn't trigger

**Why Tests Fail but Browser Works**:
- `await modal.updateComplete` in tests only waits for synchronous rendering
- It does NOT wait for async `firstUpdated()` to complete
- The test assertions run BEFORE the async slot application logic executes
- In browsers, the event loop naturally allows all async operations to complete

### Technical Details
The modal component uses a complex async pattern:
1. User adds content with `slot="body"` attribute to `<usa-modal>`
2. Component captures content in `connectedCallback()` and clears it
3. Component renders with `<slot name="body">` elements
4. Async `firstUpdated()` initializes USWDS and waits for transformation
5. USWDS transforms the modal and moves it to `document.body`
6. Component attempts to find slots and replace them with captured content

**The timing between steps 4-6 is unreliable in unit tests** due to Lit's `updateComplete` promise not waiting for async lifecycle methods.

## Evidence Slot Feature Works
From `src/components/modal/usa-modal.stories.ts`, the slot feature is actively used:
- `slot="body"` for forms and long content
- `slot="footer"` for custom button groups
- `slot="heading"` for custom headings with badges
- `slot="description"` for rich formatted descriptions

All these work correctly when viewed in Storybook.

## Current Implementation
File: `src/components/modal/usa-modal.ts`

The `applySlottedContent()` method includes:
- Retry logic (up to 40 attempts with 50ms delay = 2 second max)
- Checks for USWDS transformation completion (wrapper has `role="dialog"`)
- Finds modal content inside wrapper (structure: wrapper > overlay > modal)
- Clones nodes to prevent DOM manipulation issues
- Replaces `<slot>` elements with actual content

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Added retry logic with timeout
2. ✅ Wait for USWDS transformation (check for `role="dialog"`)
3. ✅ Added delay after USWDS initialization (100ms)
4. ✅ Clone nodes instead of moving them
5. ❌ Still fails in test environment

## Possible Solutions

### Option A: Mock USWDS Transformation in Tests
Create a test helper that properly simulates USWDS modal transformation:
```typescript
async function simulateUSWDSTransformation(modal: USAModal) {
  // Manually perform the DOM moves that USWDS does
  // This would make tests more reliable
}
```

### Option B: Use Integration Tests Instead
Move these specific tests to Cypress/Playwright where real browser timing works:
```typescript
// cypress/e2e/modal-slots.cy.ts
describe('Modal Slot Content', () => {
  it('should apply slot content after USWDS transformation', () => {
    // Test in real browser environment
  });
});
```

### Option C: Refactor Slot Application Timing
Use MutationObserver to detect when USWDS moves the modal:
```typescript
private watchForUSWDSTransformation() {
  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
    const wrapper = document.getElementById(this.modalId);
    if (wrapper?.getAttribute('role') === 'dialog') {
      this.applySlottedContent();
      observer.disconnect();
    }
  });
  observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
}
```

## Resolution (2025-10-18)

**Implemented Option B: Integration Tests**

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Cypress Tests** - `cypress/e2e/modal-storybook-test.cy.ts`
   - New test suite: "Modal - Slot Content After USWDS Transformation"
   - 6 comprehensive tests covering all slot scenarios:
     - slot="body" content application
     - slot="footer" content application
     - slot="heading" content application
     - slot="description" content application
     - Multiple slots working together
     - Functionality verification after slot application
   - Tests use real Storybook stories with actual slot usage
   - Tests verify that `<slot>` elements are replaced with actual content

2. **Skipped Unit Tests** - `src/components/modal/modal-dom-validation.test.ts`
   - All 5 slot tests marked with `.skip()`
   - Added comprehensive comment explaining:
     - Why tests are skipped (Lit `updateComplete` limitation)
     - Where to find the browser-based tests
     - Reference to this documentation

3. **Documentation Updated**
   - This file updated with resolution details
   - Status changed to "RESOLVED"

### Why This Approach Works:

1. **Browser-based Testing**: Cypress tests run in real browser environment where async lifecycle methods complete naturally
2. **Real-world Validation**: Tests use actual Storybook stories, ensuring the feature works as users will use it
3. **No Complex Mocking**: Avoids test-specific code that doesn't reflect production behavior
4. **Better Coverage**: Tests verify the complete user interaction flow (open modal, verify content, close modal)

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Run Cypress tests (requires Storybook running on port 6006)
npm run storybook    # In one terminal
npm run test:e2e     # In another terminal

# Or run Cypress interactively
npx cypress open
```

## Priority
✅ **RESOLVED** - Feature confirmed working in production, now with proper browser-based test coverage.
