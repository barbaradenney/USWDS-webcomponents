## üö® Testing Gaps & Recommendations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage Below 70%

Current coverage is 60%. Consider adding:

- Interactive testing with Cypress

## üìù Test Maintenance

- Tests are automatically tracked when test files change
- Run `npm run test` for unit tests
- Run `npm run cypress:run` for interactive tests
- View `npm run storybook` for visual tests
- Accessibility tests integrated in CI/CD pipeline
