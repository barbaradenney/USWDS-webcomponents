‚úÖ **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and keyboard interactions tested
‚úÖ **Focus Management**: Focus states and indicators working
‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: axe-core accessibility validation integrated
‚úÖ **Early Detection**: Same testing as Storybook, available during `npm test`

### Current Accessibility Status

**Status**: 2 accessibility checks require manual verification (matches Storybook findings):

- `aria-prohibited-attr`: Elements must only use permitted ARIA attributes
- `color-contrast`: Elements must meet minimum color contrast ratio thresholds

These findings match exactly what Storybook's accessibility addon detects, confirming our integration is working correctly.

### Screen Reader Compatibility
