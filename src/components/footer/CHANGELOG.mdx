## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **USWDS Compliance Fix (2025-10-12)** - Removed identifier rendering from footer component. The identifier is a separate USWDS component (`<usa-identifier>`) that should be placed AFTER the footer on the page, not nested inside it. This fixes spacing issues and aligns with official USWDS architecture. All Storybook stories updated to demonstrate correct usage.

  - Enhanced component validation and behavior testing
  - Improved test reliability and edge case coverage
  - Added comprehensive accessibility testing with axe-core integration
