# USWDS Validation Pre-commit Hook (Placeholder)
#
# NOTE: This hook is currently a placeholder for future USWDS-specific validations.
# The transformation validator was removed because it checked for outdated "Option B" patterns.
#
# Current USWDS validation is handled by:
# - npm run validate:uswds-compliance (step 4/9 in main pre-commit)
# - npm run validate:component-javascript (step 10/10 in main pre-commit)
#
# These validators check:
# - HTML structure and CSS classes match USWDS
# - USWDS JavaScript integration (USWDS.componentName.on() calls)
# - Script tag pattern is followed
#
# The old transformation validator checked for module imports and DOM transformation
# which doesn't apply to the current Script Tag Pattern architecture.
